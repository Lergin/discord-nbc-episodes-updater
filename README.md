# NBC Episodes Update Discord Webhook

This is a script that checks the nbc website for new full episodes that are availbale to stream on there website and then sends a message to a discord channel.

To add this to your own discordserver you could just host this script yourself and edit the config file or just open https://lergin.github.io/discord-nbc-episodes-updater/ and add the link of the webhook and then select the shows you want to get updates for and my server will also send a message to the discord.
